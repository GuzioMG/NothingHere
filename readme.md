# NothingHere
This project is ment to be used as a GitPod workspace creator. If you want to build a private project, but don't want to pay for an enterprise GitPod license, this is a good place to start. Just click on button on top of the page and a new, blank GitPod workspace will be added to your account.

## Rights
Since I put literally no work into this, you can go ahead and do anything you want. No license, boys!

## Image
I chose default + VNC image. Default got described as "Ready to Code. Supports Java, Go, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.", so it's the best place to start. VNC support added, as some people may find it useful for their project.
